=head1 NAME

Plack::Middleware::LogAny - Use Log::Any to handle logging from your Plack app

=head1 SYNOPSIS

builder {
	enable "LogAny", category => "plack";
	$app;
}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

LogAny is a L<Plack::Middleware> component that allows you to use L<Log::Any>
to handle the logging object, C<psgix.logger>.

It really tries to be the thinnest possible shim, so it doesn't handle any
configuration beyond setting the category to which messages from plack might be
logged.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 prepare_app

This method initializes the logger using the category that you (optionally)
set.

=head2 call

Actually handles making sure the logger is invoked.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

=over 4

=item category

The C<Log::Any> category to send logs to. Defaults to C<''> which means it send
to the root logger.
