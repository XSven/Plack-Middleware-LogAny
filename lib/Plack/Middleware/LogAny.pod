=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # in app.psgi file
  use Plack::Builder;

  # PSGI application
  my $app = sub { ... };

  # DSL interface
  builder {
    enable 'LogAny', category => 'plack', header_names => [ qw( X-Request-ID ) ];

=head1 DESCRIPTION

LogAny is a L<Plack::Middleware> component that allows you to use L<Log::Any>
to handle the logging object, C<psgix.logger> that is described in
L<PSGI::Extensions>.

It really tries to be the thinnest possible shim, so it doesn't handle any
configuration beyond setting the category to which messages from PSGI might
be logged.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 prepare_app()

This method initializes the logger using the category that you (optionally)
set.

=head2 call()

Actually handles making sure the logger is invoked.

=head1 CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

=over 4

=item category

The C<Log::Any> category to send logs to. Defaults to C<''> which means it send
to the root logger.
