application

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # in app.psgi file
  use Plack::Builder;

  # PSGI application
  my $app = sub { ... };

  # DSL interface
  builder {
    enable 'LogAny', category => 'plack', context => [ qw( X-Request-ID ) ];
    $app;
  }

  # alternative OO interface
  Plack::Middleware::LogAny->wrap( $app, category => 'plack', context => [ qw( X-Request-ID ) ] );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

LogAny is a L<Plack::Middleware> component that allows you to use L<Log::Any>
to handle the C<psgix.logger> logging object. This object is a code reference
that is described in L<PSGI::Extensions>.

This middleware component really tries to be the thinnest possible shim, so it
doesn't handle any configuration beyond setting the category to which messages
from the PSGI application might be logged.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 prepare_app()

This method initializes the logger using the category that you (optionally)
set.

=head2 call()

This method sets the logging object and the logging context. The logging
context is localized.

=head1 CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

environment|PSGI/"The Environment"> to the C<Log::Any> logging context.
